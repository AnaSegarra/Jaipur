# Jaipur
## Game project - Ironhack Web Dev Bootcamp

Jaipur is a web adaptation of the homonymous board game in which the player will be competing against the machine to become the best (and richer) trader. The game ends if there are no cards left in the draw pile or three types of goods token are unavailable. Player with the highest score wins the game!  

## Rules
As this is a simpler version, there won't be any camels and it'll be a one round game, but the rules are essentially the same as in the original game. So go ahead and take a look at them before playing, [[EN]](https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules2/Jaipur-rules.pdf) - [[ES]](https://www.jugonesweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Instrucciones-Jaipur.pdf)
